# Graduate-Capstone-Project

This repository contains two papers documenting my capstone project, which focused on addressing a critical cybersecurity problem through a comprehensive design and implementation process.

## Part 1: Problem Identification and Solution Design

- Identified a significant cybersecurity issue, analyzing its root causes, stakeholder impact, and environmental context.

- Conducted research using historical data, vulnerability scans, and industry standards to design a robust solution.

- Outlined project requirements, implementation phases, risk assessments, and resource allocation.

- Developed a training program, project deliverables, and a detailed timeline with milestones.

- Created an evaluation plan, including formative and summative testing, acceptance criteria, and performance indicators.

## Part 2: Solution Implementation and Post-Implementation Analysis

- Implemented the cybersecurity solution, adopting policies to improve decision-making and align with industry standards.

- Ensured the solution promoted automation, modernized security, and addressed data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- Developed cybersecurity plans, standards, and procedures, including tools, installation guides, and user documentation.

- Analyzed the post-implementation environment, evaluating improvements to the organizationâ€™s security posture and efficiency.

- Conducted a summative evaluation, addressing weaknesses, post-implementation risks, and stakeholder needs.

- Delivered a maintenance plan and original artifacts (e.g., security policies, network diagrams) as part of the completed project.

This project demonstrates my ability to identify, design, implement, and evaluate a cybersecurity solution, showcasing technical expertise and strategic problem-solving skills. Feel free to explore the papers for detailed insights into the process and outcomes.
